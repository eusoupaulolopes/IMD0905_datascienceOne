In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about [New York City public schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data?cat=education). We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the **DBN** column. All of the data sets are currently stored as **keys** in the **data** dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n","\n","In this section, **we'll clean the data a bit more**, then **combine** it. Finally, we'll **compute correlations** and perform some analysis.\n","\n","The first thing we'll need to do in preparation for the merge is condense some of the data sets. In the last section, we noticed that the values in the **DBN** column were unique in the **sat_results** data set. Other data sets like **class_size** had duplicate **DBN** values, however.\n","\n","We'll need to condense these data sets so that each value in the **DBN** column is unique. If not, we'll run into issues when it comes time to combine the data sets.\n","\n","While the main data set we want to analyze, **sat_results**, has unique **DBN** values for every high school in New York City, other data sets aren't as clean. A single row in the **sat_results** data set may match multiple rows in the **class_size** data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the **class_size** data set we should combine with the single matching entry in **sat_results**.

We'll be using the pandas [pandas.DataFrame.merge()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function, which supports four types of joins -- **left**, **right**, **inner**, and **outer**. Each of these join types dictates how pandas combines the rows.\n","\n","We'll be using the **DBN** column to identify matching rows across data sets. In other words, the values in that column will help us know which row from the first data set to combine with which row in the second data set.\n","\n","There may be **DBN** values that exist in one data set but not in another. This is partly because the data is from different years. Each data set also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the **DBN** values in **sat_results** in all of the other data sets, and other data sets may have **DBN** values that don't exist in **sat_results**.\n","\n","We'll merge two data sets at a time. For example, we'll merge **sat_results** and **hs_directory**, then merge the result with **ap_2010**, then merge the result of that with **class_size**. We'll continue combining data sets in this way until we've merged all of them.

Choosing a merge strategy is an important decision; it's worth thinking about your data carefully, and what trade-offs you're willing to make.\n","\n","Because this project is concerned with determing demographic factors that correlate with SAT score, we'll want to preserve as many rows as possible from **sat_results** while minimizing null values.\n","\n","This means that we may need to use different merge strategies with different data sets. Some of the data sets have a lot of missing **DBN** values. This makes a **left** join more appropriate, because we don't want to lose too many rows when we merge. If we did an **inner** join, we would lose the data for many high schools.\n","\n","Some data sets have **DBN** values that are almost identical to those in **sat_results**. Those data sets also have information we need to keep. Most of our analysis would be impossible if a significant number of rows was missing from **demographics**, for example.
